  It make me shock on how powerful that it can do. I think it can combine and adapt to create almost every wonderful thing,
  But it is one reason that make me think \"I'm not good at Front-End\" because the one thing that I think it is the hardest thing in CSS,
  It is \"Naming the CSS class name\" (LoL!!~<code>)</code>, I can't name it perfectly to read and understand immediately that make my every class name is very long.

  In the server-side programming, PHP is the first language that I've tried in my classroom, I didn't like it much because of some limitation of it.
  After that I've found some word call \"MEAN Stack\", That bring me to javascript world and search about NodeJS and enjoy the module system at first time,
  And more more more from a lot of library/framework that come with it. I've tried Express, MongoDB, Everything work!! But I got some problems on the last framework...
  Angular 2 because it is the first time of me on component style web programming, I have to practice more to know all features of it.
